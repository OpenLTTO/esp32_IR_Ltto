# ESP32-RMT-Library-IR-code-RAW

This code is to help anyone out there trying to send and receive IR codes with the ESP32.

This is a simple code to receive and then save IR received by an IR sensor connected to the ESP32 and then resend 
it back out via an IR LED   

Reason that I created this I could not find any complete examples of IR send and Received in the RAW format,
I am hoping this code can then be used * to build on the existing IR libraries out there.
